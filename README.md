## Description

Seamless Mirror-Sync: Your Effortless Repository Synchronization Engine
Unlock true simplicity for keeping your mirrors aligned. Mirror-Sync is a clean, high-performance Go tool built to automate the replication of repositories with minimal fuss — no manual toil, no drift, no surprises.

### Why you’ll love it

- 📦 Plug-and-play: Drop the binary in, point it at your source & destination, configure via environment variables, and you’re done.

- 🔁 Reliable mirroring: Whether you’re syncing from one endpoint to another or maintaining multiple mirrors, Mirror-Sync keeps everything in step with precision.

- 🛠 Modern and lean: Written in Go with a minimal shell build wrapper, it’s designed for speed, simplicity and low-footprint deployment (Linux, containers, whatever you like).

In short
Mirror-Sync takes the headache out of repository mirroring. Set it up once, configure it easily, and forget about it — while knowing your mirrors stay consistent, aligned and up-to-date.
